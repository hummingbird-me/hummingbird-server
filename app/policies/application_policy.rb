  # Generally, Pundit takes a `user` instead of a `token`, but to make OAuth2
  # scope handling simpler, we pass in `token` instead and then manually look
  # up the `user` based on that.  This allows us to put scope handling in the
  # Policy layer instead of up at the Resource or Controller layer, simplifying
  # logic and centralizing all authorization code in one place.
